# Dataset Sources â€“ Team B: EHR Imaging Documentation System

This project integrates multiple medical imaging modalities and electronic health record (EHR) datasets to build an EHR-Imaging Documentation System. The datasets uploaded in this repository provide both structured clinical records and unstructured imaging data that can be combined for multimodal analysis.
